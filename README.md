**ZotPlanner** is a smart, all-in-one productivity tool designed for UCI students. It helps students organize class schedules, deadlines, and track their coursework in a clean, intuitive interface. Users can upload syllabi, build custom weekly planners, and stay on top of assignments and study sessions. Built with React and powered by AWS, **ZotPlanner** streamlines academic planning for a more productive quarter.

## 🚨 Problem
